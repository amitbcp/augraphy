# Documentation

This is the top level of the Augraphy documentation.

In most cases, docs here match the directory structure of the [main project](https://github.com/sparkfish/augraphy/tree/dev), so information about a specific augmentation will appear in the [augmentations directory](https://github.com/sparkfish/augraphy/tree/dev/doc/augmentations/).
